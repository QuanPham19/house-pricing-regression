House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

The project is about using Data Manipulation, Preprocessor Pipeline and Machine Learning algorithms to predict the pricing of houses.

1. Classifying 79 columns to numerical or categorical, visualized data correlation with histograms and Q-Q plot



2. Using OneHotEncoder, SimpleImputer, StandardScaler and PCA from Scikit-learn library to standardize data pipeline and preprocessor



3. Conducting Machine Learning model with 3 regressor layers of Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost, reaching the best mean squared error of 0.14
